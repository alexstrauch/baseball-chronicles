          <h1>The early days of baseball</h1>
            <p>
                Baseball's origins are rooted in a blend of various bat-and-ball games 
                that were popular in Europe, particularly in England, during the 18th 
                century. Among these, the game of “rounders” played a significant role 
                in shaping early versions of baseball. When European immigrants brought 
                these games to North America, they evolved into different forms, with 
                “town ball” being one of the more popular variants played in the United States.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the early 19th century, these various informal games began to coalesce into 
                something more recognizable as modern baseball. The turning point came in 1845 
                when Alexander Cartwright, a member of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club in New York, 
                formalized a set of rules. Known as the “Knickerbocker Rules,” these guidelines 
                standardized the game, including key elements like the diamond-shaped field, 
                the concept of three strikes, and the elimination of practices like “soaking” 
                (hitting a runner with a thrown ball to make an out).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first recorded baseball game played under these new rules took place on 
                June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey, between the Knickerbockers and a team 
                called the New York Nine. Although the Knickerbockers lost, this game is often 
                cited as the first official baseball game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As the sport grew in popularity, especially after the Civil War, it became 
                more organized, with professional leagues forming in the late 19th century. 
                Baseball quickly became a central part of American culture, earning its place 
                as the nation's pastime and expanding internationally in the years that followed.
