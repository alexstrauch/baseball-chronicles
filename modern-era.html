        <h2>The modern era of baseball</h2>
        <section class="overview">
            <p>
                The modern era of baseball, beginning in the early 20th century, has seen significant 
                evolution and growth. The establishment of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1903 marked 
                the formal unification of the American and National Leagues, setting the stage for 
                the World Series, an annual championship that quickly became one of the most anticipated 
                events in sports. This era also witnessed the rise of legendary players like Babe Ruth, 
                whose home run-hitting prowess in the 1920s transformed the game and elevated its popularity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A pivotal moment in baseball's history came in 1947 when Jackie Robinson broke the 
                color barrier by joining the Brooklyn Dodgers, becoming the first African American player 
                in MLB. His courage and talent paved the way for the integration of the sport, 
                which had previously been segregated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The post-World War II period saw baseball's expansion with the introduction of new teams, 
                such as the New York Mets and the Houston Astros, as well as the relocation of existing 
                teams like the Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast. This era also featured the rise of 
                television, which brought baseball into the homes of millions of fans, increasing its 
                reach and influence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The 1960s and 70s introduced changes like the designated hitter rule in the American League 
                and the expansion of the playoff system. However, the sport also faced challenges, including 
                labor disputes that led to strikes, the most significant being the 1994 strike, which resulted 
                in the cancellation of the World Series.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The late 1990s were marked by a surge in home runs, highlighted by the epic home run race 
                between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa in 1998. However, this period was later tainted by 
                revelations of widespread steroid use, leading to a major scandal and stricter drug testing policies.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In the 21st century, baseball has increasingly embraced technology and analytics. 
                The rise of sabermetrics, popularized by the “Moneyball” approach, has revolutionized 
                how teams evaluate players and strategies. Additionally, MLB has focused on speeding up the game, 
                implementing rule changes like the pitch clock to address concerns about the sport's pace and to 
                attract younger fans.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Internationally, baseball has grown, with players from countries like Japan, the Dominican Republic, 
                and Venezuela becoming stars in the MLB. The World Baseball Classic, introduced in 2006, further highlights 
                the global appeal of the game.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Today, while baseball faces competition from other sports, it remains a deeply rooted part of American culture, 
                with a loyal fanbase and a rich history that continues to evolve.
