            <h1>About baseball</h1>
            <p>
              Baseball, often referred to as America's pastime, is a sport with 
              deep roots in the United States and a rich history that spans over a century. 
              The game is played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns 
              batting and fielding.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The basic objective is to score runs by hitting a pitched ball with a bat 
              and running around four bases counter-clockwise arranged in a diamond shape. 
              A run is scored when a player successfully circles the bases and returns to home plate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game. 
              Key elements of the game include pitching, hitting, fielding, and base running.
            </p>
